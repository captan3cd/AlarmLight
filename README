An Arduino powered dimmer. The goal is to create a light dimmer that can slowly turn on a light at a scheduled time. Includes the ability to set the alarm time through bluetooth and to manually turn the light on or off with a button.

Compile
The ino file should be compiled from Arduino's IDE. If using a Nano V3 the board should be set to "Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila" and the processor to "ATmega328p".
The following libraries need to be added to Arduino's library folder.
RTClib <https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/rt-clib>
TimerOne <https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/timer-one>
